""" stentseg

This library provides functionality to perform segmentation of a stent
graft from 3D CT data.

In the current situation the algorithms are assumed to return a model
of the graph based on a geometric graph, but additional models may be
added later.

This library is written for Python 3, and probably also works for Python 2.
